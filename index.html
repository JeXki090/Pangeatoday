	<h1>Pangea Today</h1>
</center>






<h1>Although Pangea no longer exists, its legacy can still be seen today. The movement of the tectonic plates continues to shape the Earth's surface, creating new mountain ranges and causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Additionally, the study of Pangea has helped scientists better understand the history of our planet and the processes that have shaped it over millions of years. It serves as a reminder of the incredible geological forces at work beneath our feet.</h1>
